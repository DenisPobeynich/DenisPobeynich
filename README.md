## Short about myself
> Hi, there! Nice to meet you! My name is Denis. I was born in Ukraine, Kramatorsk. I have been studying in Moscow, Russia for 8 years now. And at the moment I am a 4th year student at the Moscow State Conservatory. I play a wonderful instrument - a modern trumpet, and I play it in many cool orchestras and in the Russian Academic Youth Theater. But since childhood, deep down, I want to learn how to write code and work with information technology, and I also want to be the best specialist in this field.
                    It's time for big plans. I'm on the way, wish me luck!
